We want to implement SSL technology to blockchain so decided to build onchain private messaging app. Diffie Hellman protocol was invented at 1978 we find a better one invited by Eric JÃ¤rpe at 2020. This new key exchange algorithm uses elliptic curves for generating random g values. So it has advantages against quantum computer attacks.We get this new protocol implemented with solidity. So it can usable onchain.To show proof of concept of our work we also implement peer to peer on-chain private messaging app. So you can basically log in with your lens profile and send conversation requests to anyone. After handshake all sides has unique communication private key and easily chat.
